      <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

      <p>It is still early in my learning experience, yet that should not be looked at in a negative manner.  Instead, lets look at this
         as an opportunity to learn!  Being new to coding and learning to code today is actually a great thing.  Learning to code now, 
         allows me to learn tried and true techniques and practices, methods that have been truly put to the test.  Languages that have\
         lasted the test of time, and functionality.  When I first got into computers 20 years ago, C++ and Java where the newest, and 
         hottest thing out there, besides Microsoft.  Today, there are NUMEROUS languages out there, along with libraries, extensions, apps,
         and a huge community of people, that learning to code may SEEM intimidating, but in truth, is more supported and easier to learn 
         than every before.
